A learning project focused on Convolutional Neural Networks for Face and Object Detection, built using industry-standard project structure.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Learn CNN fundamentals through hands-on implementation
- Practice professional ML project organization
- Build face and object detection models
- Document the learning journey

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start with the learning notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/test1.ipynb
```

### Current Progress
- [ ] Data collection and exploration
- [ ] Basic CNN implementation
